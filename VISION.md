# 🌟 EducationHub Vision

> “Empowering Cambodian learners and educators with technology-driven, inclusive, and accessible education.”

EducationHub began as an open-source project to centralize school and scholarship information in Cambodia. Now, we are expanding our vision to address a broader challenge: **modernizing education through technology.**

## Why This Matters

Many students across Cambodia still lack access to reliable education resources, especially in rural areas. By using modern technology, we can close the gap and create more opportunities for students, teachers, and communities.

To create a tech-powered education ecosystem that:
- Makes **educational data** accessible to all
- Provides **digital learning tools** for students and schools

- Bridges the **urban-rural education divide**
